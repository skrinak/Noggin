More than a million people suffer an mTBI (mild traumatic brain injury) in the UK every year, yet our healthcare system systematically fails them. The majority receive no follow-up after initial review, left to independently navigate their recovery, with minimal guidance on when to seek care and what resources are available to them. This results in a predictable pattern: patients feel neglected, interventions are delayed, and specialist resources, already under strain, are scattered rather than strategically allocated. 


The clinical challenge of mTBI stems from its diagnostic nature. Unlike more severe traumatic brain injuries, mTBIs often exist in the absence of readily detectable radiological damage. Accurate assessment relies on a clinical picture which integrates patient history, symptom patterns, and recovery progression from the moment of impact through the months following. This creates an inherent dependence on longitudinal patient-clinician communication, which is cost and time prohibitive in traditional care models. Yet, this temporal dilemma is precisely what determines whether a patient’s 'mild' injury resolves uneventfully within 3-4 weeks or progresses to persistent dysfunction and disability, which affects 5-15% of cases. 


Digital health interventions uniquely address this problem by maintaining continuous engagement in the critical recovery window, documenting symptom progression that would otherwise be lost between encounters. This informs a detailed narrative which enables providers to facilitate tailored care to unique symptom patterns, while ensuring that patients feel supported and informed. 


I developed and tested ‘Noggin’ with University of Cambridge athletes during my MPhil. Noggin is a virtual concussion guide accessible via WhatsApp, SMS, or by call. Noggin uses a validated assessment to gauge the severity of injury and create tailored treatment recommendations sourced directly from NHS guidelines. Noggin employs established thresholds to triage users to clinically appropriate intervention, escalating to physician care when symptoms warrant medical evaluation. It then translates these conversations into a clinical dashboard allowing providers to track symptom changes. 


The translational potential for Noggin extends beyond mTBI, establishing a framework for large language model (LLM) integration in a clinical setting where conditions require remote monitoring, triage, patient education, self-management support, and overcoming barriers to care. This work is not about replacing clinicians, it is about restructuring care delivery to match clinical needs and efficiently utilize resources. 


Research Question: 

What is the clinical validity, safety, and implementation feasibility of using a conversational interface for longitudinal monitoring and triage in mild traumatic brain injury management? What are the fundamental principles, implementation determinants and translational frameworks which govern the integration of LLM based interventions in a clinical healthcare setting? 


Timetable: 

Year 1: Conduct systematic literature review on LLMs in clinical settings and digital health interventions for symptom monitoring and triage, examine triage sensitivity, decision-making, and human oversight mechanisms. Launch multi-site testing in UK universities with a goal of 500 participants. Collect data on engagement, adherence, and reporting patterns. 


Year 2: Analyze Year 1 data to inform refinement of Noggin. Use feasibility studies to facilitate application for MHRA and IRAS. Execute retrospective cohort study using NHS administrative datasets (HES and DARS) to map mTBI care utilization.

Year 3: Intensive recruitment in university setting, GP practices, Addenbrookes, and the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery (NHNN). Test Noggin alongside clinicians, comparing efficacy and decision-making. Develop and validate risk stratification algorithms. Establish a framework for LLM clinical integration beyond mTBI. Evaluate direct impact of Noggin on clinical care.
