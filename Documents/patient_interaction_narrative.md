# Noggin mTBI Management: Patient Interaction Narrative

This document describes a typical interaction flow between a patient and the Noggin mTBI management system, corresponding to the numbered flow in the architecture diagram.

## Scenario: University Rugby Player with Possible Concussion

### Initial Contact and Assessment (Steps 1-6)

**Step 1: Initial Contact**

Sam, a 20-year-old university rugby player, experiences a head collision during practice. The team's athletic trainer suggests using Noggin for monitoring. Sam initiates contact through:

- WhatsApp by messaging the Noggin service number
- Alternatively, Sam could use the Noggin mobile application

**Step 2: Channel to API Gateway**

- The messaging service forwards Sam's initial message to AWS API Gateway
- API Gateway authenticates the request and validates the format
- A session ID is generated to maintain conversation continuity

**Step 3: API Gateway to Intake Service**

- The API Gateway routes the request to the Intake Lambda function
- Request metadata is logged for compliance and auditing
- The Intake Lambda initializes a new patient assessment workflow

**Step 4: Initial Assessment**

- The Intake Lambda invokes the AWS Bedrock Intake Agent
- The Intake Agent communicates with Claude Sonnet 4.5 LLM to process and understand patient inputs
- Claude Sonnet 4.5 applies its medical knowledge and conversational abilities to:
  - Interpret patient descriptions with medical context awareness
  - Generate natural, empathetic responses appropriate for medical context
  - Maintain conversation flow even with unclear patient inputs
- The agent orchestrates the assessment process, following standardized mTBI evaluation protocols:
  - Glasgow Coma Scale assessment
  - SCAT5 (Sport Concussion Assessment Tool) symptom evaluation
  - Risk factor identification
  - Medical history gathering

**Step 5: Voice Processing (if applicable)**

- If Sam uses a voice call for the assessment:
  - AWS Transcribe Medical converts speech to text for processing
  - The transcription maintains medical terminology accuracy
  - The transcript is returned to the Intake Lambda for agent processing

**Step 6: Data Storage**

- Patient information and assessment results are stored in DynamoDB
- Data is encrypted at rest using AWS KMS
- Symptom baseline metrics are established for future comparison

### Monitoring and Intervention (Steps 7-10)

**Step 7: Monitoring Workflow Initiation**

- The Intake Lambda triggers EventBridge with an assessment-complete event
- EventBridge routes to the Monitoring Lambda function
- The monitoring schedule is set based on symptom severity (e.g., daily check-ins)

**Step 8: Ongoing Symptom Monitoring**

- At scheduled intervals, the Monitoring Agent reaches out to Sam
- The agent leverages Claude Sonnet 4.5 LLM to:
  - Engage in natural follow-up conversations that build on previous interactions
  - Detect subtle changes in patient responses and sentiment
  - Adapt questioning based on emerging symptom patterns
- The agent collects updated symptom information through conversational dialogue
- Claude Sonnet 4.5 assists with pattern recognition to detect changes from the baseline
- The system identifies concerning patterns like symptom persistence or worsening

**Step 9: Intervention Planning**

- Based on monitoring data, the system activates the intervention process
- The Intervention Agent sends structured symptom data to Claude Sonnet 4.5 LLM
- Claude Sonnet 4.5 analyzes the data and generates personalized recommendations by:
  - Comparing patient's symptom progression against expected recovery trajectories
  - Accessing its knowledge of best practices in concussion management
  - Synthesizing NHS guidelines for mTBI management into personalized advice
- The Intervention Agent and LLM collaborate to create interventions that may include:
  - Rest protocols tailored to symptom severity
  - Individualized gradual return-to-activity guidelines
  - Cognitive exercises appropriate for current recovery stage
  - Headache management techniques specific to reported symptom patterns

**Step 10: Response Delivery**

- The system delivers personalized guidance to Sam through:
  - Audio responses generated by AWS Polly (for voice interactions)
  - Text messages (for WhatsApp/SMS)
  - Mobile app notifications with interactive exercises
- Sam receives daily updates and recovery tracking visualizations

### Clinical Escalation (Steps 11-15)

**Step 11: Detection of Concerning Patterns**

- After five days, the Monitoring Agent identifies potential concerns in Sam's reported symptoms
- The agent sends the longitudinal symptom data to Claude Sonnet 4.5 LLM for analysis
- Claude Sonnet 4.5 performs a comprehensive evaluation by:
  - Analyzing temporal patterns in symptom reporting
  - Comparing against expected recovery trajectories from medical literature
  - Identifying risk factors requiring clinical attention
- The LLM determines that persistent dizziness and headache require clinical evaluation
- The Escalation Agent receives this assessment and triggers the Escalation Lambda
- The Escalation Lambda is activated with relevant patient data

**Step 12-13: Clinician Notification and Dashboard Access**

- Dr. Johnson, a neurologist at the university health service, receives an alert
- The notification includes symptom progression data and risk assessment
- Dr. Johnson accesses the clinical dashboard through the web application
- The dashboard displays:
  - Longitudinal symptom data visualization
  - Raw interaction transcripts
  - AI-generated clinical summary
  - Recommended follow-up actions

**Step 14-15: Data Retrieval for Clinical Decision Support**

- Dr. Johnson reviews Sam's complete symptom history
- The clinical dashboard pulls data from DynamoDB through secure API calls
- Dr. Johnson schedules an in-person assessment
- The appointment details are synchronized with Noggin to maintain continuity of care

## Outcome and Follow-up

- Sam receives an in-person evaluation from Dr. Johnson
- Clinical findings are documented in the Noggin system
- The system adapts its monitoring approach based on clinical input
- Sam continues using Noggin throughout recovery with adjusted parameters
- Once symptoms resolve, the system transitions to a maintenance schedule

## Key System Capabilities Demonstrated

1. **LLM-Powered Interaction**: Leveraging Claude Sonnet 4.5 across all agents to enable natural, context-aware, and medically informed conversations with patients.

2. **Seamless Multi-Channel Interaction**: Supporting WhatsApp, SMS, voice, and mobile app interfaces to meet patients where they are.

3. **AI-Driven Triage**: Combining agent orchestration with LLM capabilities to implement validated assessment protocols and determine appropriate intervention levels.

4. **Intelligent Longitudinal Monitoring**: Using Claude Sonnet 4.5's pattern recognition and contextual understanding to track symptoms over time and detect concerning trends.

5. **Clinical Integration**: Bridging patient self-reporting with clinical oversight through dashboards and LLM-generated clinical summaries.

6. **LLM-Enhanced Intervention Planning**: Creating personalized recommendations by combining structured medical guidelines with Claude Sonnet 4.5's ability to tailor information to individual patients.

7. **Advanced Escalation Protocol**: Using LLM analysis to identify cases requiring clinical attention with clear handoff procedures.

8. **Comprehensive Data Continuity**: Maintaining complete patient history across all touchpoints, enhanced by the LLM's ability to synthesize and contextualize information for decision-making.

This narrative demonstrates how Noggin leverages Claude Sonnet 4.5 LLM across specialized agents to address the critical monitoring gap in mTBI care through continuous engagement, intelligent analysis, personalized interventions, and appropriate clinical escalation when needed.
